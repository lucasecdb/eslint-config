# eslint configuration

hey there! ðŸ‘‹ this is my personal eslint configuration, feel free to use at any project
or copy this repo settings to setup your own config and publish it to your favorite package registry!

## installation

```bash
yarn add -D @lucasecdb/eslint-config
```

create a `.eslintrc` file at the root of your project if you didn't already,
alongside the `node_modules` folder, and extend this config like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "@lucasecdb",
  "env": {
    "es6": true
  }
}
```

and that's it!
